## Everything beneath is old. Use new packer "unpack.py"

Unpacker for SPLCrypt that uses Mandiant Speakeasy bin emulator. In addition to the requirements in requirements.txt, speakeasy must be installed. Speakeasy can be found here: https://github.com/mandiant/speakeasy

Please note: SPLCrypt is actively developed and this unpacker will not work on the newer versions. I wrote this specifically for a blog post and to mess with Speakeasy.
